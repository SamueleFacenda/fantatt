# How does this work/what does it need to do

You can subscribe as a single user (email + password)
A league is created by a single user, that insert all the members teams and credits.
There should be a player list (or a query player box).
Every week a score is given to each player (or just the used ones), it will also
be good to preview it
A match result must be computed, using the team plan given by the players. 
A team plan (formazione, non so come si dica in inglese), should contain three(?) main players
and and order of reserves (that are deployed if a main has not played).
If a plan is not submitted the one from the last week is used (or a random/automatic one).
For every league there is a score for each manager, a scoreboard, an history(next step) and
a match calendar.
A double italian round is used (gone and return?)
